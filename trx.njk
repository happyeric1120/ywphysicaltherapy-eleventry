  <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-teal-400 mb-6">Why I Use TRX in My Physical Therapy Approach</h2>

  <p class="text-lg text-gray-200 mb-6">
    TRX is one of the most versatile tools I use in my Midtown Manhattan studio near Penn Station. Unlike machines or
    heavy weights, TRX uses your own bodyweight to build **movement control, core stability, balance, and strength** in a
    way that translates directly into real-life movement.
  </p>

  <p class="text-lg text-gray-200 mb-6">
    Many people who come to see me don’t just need soft-tissue work—they need their muscles, joints, and nervous system
    to work together again. TRX helps rebuild that coordination safely and effectively. It is especially useful when
    combined with technologies like 
    <a href="/shockwave" class="text-teal-300 underline">shockwave therapy</a>,
    <a href="/tecar" class="text-teal-300 underline">TECAR therapy</a>,
    <a href="/class-4-laser" class="text-teal-300 underline">Class 4 laser</a>,
    or <a href="/compex" class="text-teal-300 underline">Compex EMS</a>.
