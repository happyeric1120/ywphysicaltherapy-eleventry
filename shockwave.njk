  <!-- INTRO -->
  <h2 class="text-4xl font-extrabold text-teal-400 mb-6">What is Shockwave Therapy?</h2>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-200 mb-4">
    <span class="font-semibold text-teal-300">Shockwave therapy</span> is a non-invasive treatment that uses high-energy
    sound waves to stimulate healing in painful muscles, tendons, and joints. In my physical therapy studio in Midtown
    Manhattan—just minutes from Penn Station—I use both focused and radial shockwave to help people reduce long-standing
    tightness, tendon pain, and deep tissue irritation that other treatments often miss.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-200 mb-6">
    Shockwave helps break up scar tissue, improve circulation, and activate the body’s natural repair process. There are
    no needles and no medications—just sound waves working with your body. I often combine shockwave with
    AI-guided movement analysis, TECAR therapy, Class 4 laser, and Compex EMS to address not only where you feel pain,
    but <span class="italic">why</span> those tissues keep getting irritated.
  </p>

  <!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">How Shockwave Therapy Works</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 mb-8 space-y-2">
    <li>Sound waves are delivered directly into the injured or overloaded area.</li>
    <li>The waves create controlled micro-stress that boosts healing and reduces chronic inflammation.</li>
    <li>Your body responds by repairing tissue, breaking down scar tissue, and decreasing pain sensitivity.</li>
    <li>The result: stronger, healthier, and more resilient tissue over time.</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- RSWT vs FSWT -->
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-400 mb-6">Radial vs Focused Shockwave</h2>
  <div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-6 mb-12">

    <!-- Radial -->
    <div class="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-2xl flex-1 shadow-lg">
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-teal-400 mb-4">Radial Shockwave (RSWT)</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-4 text-gray-300 space-y-2">
        <li>Waves spread outward like ripples in water.</li>
        <li>Best for larger or more superficial areas—like general muscle tension.</li>
        <li>Great for mild–moderate tendon issues or stubborn muscle knots.</li>
        <li>Useful for “waking up” tissue before corrective exercise.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Focused -->
    <div class="bg-gray-900 border border-teal-500 p-6 rounded-2xl flex-1 shadow-xl">
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-teal-300 mb-4">Focused Shockwave (FSWT)</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-4 text-gray-300 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>Energy is focused into a single, deeper point.</li>
        <li>Reaches tissues other treatments can’t—ideal for chronic or deep pain.</li>
        <li>Precise targeting allows me to treat the true source of the problem.</li>
        <li>Supported by strong research for long-term tissue regeneration.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="bg-teal-800/30 p-4 rounded-xl text-sm text-white">
        <strong class="text-teal-200">Why I choose focused shockwave:</strong><br>
        If your pain is deep, persistent, or hasn’t improved with other care, focused shockwave often creates the
        breakthrough needed—especially when paired with the right corrective exercises.

  <!-- CONDITIONS -->
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Conditions I Treat with Shockwave</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-200 mb-4">
    Shockwave is particularly effective for stubborn, load-sensitive conditions. I commonly use it for:

  <!-- WHY CHOOSE ME -->
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-400 mb-4">Why People Choose Shockwave with Me</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-200 mb-4">
    Many clinics offer shockwave as a quick add-on. I approach it differently. Each session is one-on-one, and I use
    shockwave as part of a complete, individualized physical therapy plan—not a standalone tool.

    <li>A strategic mix of <span class="font-semibold">focused + radial shockwave</span> when deeper layers both need attention.</li>
    <li>Integration with TECAR therapy, <a href="/class-4-laser" class="text-teal-400 underline hover:text-teal-200">Class 4 laser</a>,

    Shockwave is a strong option if you’ve tried stretching, massage, or basic exercise and still feel like your pain
    keeps returning—especially in tendon-related areas. I’ll assess your symptoms, movement patterns, and goals, and
    help you decide whether focused shockwave, radial shockwave, or another technology is the best fit.

      <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">Does shockwave therapy hurt?</summary>

        Most people feel a strong tapping or pressure sensation. It can be intense over sensitive spots, but I always
        adjust the energy level to your comfort. You stay in control—I can pause or modify at any time.
