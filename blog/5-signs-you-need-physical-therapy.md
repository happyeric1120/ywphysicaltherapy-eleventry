Physical therapy isn't just for recovering from major injuries or surgeries. In fact, some of the most successful treatments happen when people seek help early, before small problems become big ones.

## The 5 Warning Signs

### 1. Pain That Lasts More Than 3 Days
If you've been dealing with pain for more than a few days, it's time to get it checked. What starts as a "minor tweak" can quickly develop into a chronic issue if the underlying cause isn't addressed.

### 2. You're Avoiding Activities You Love
When you start skipping your morning jog, avoiding lifting your grandkids, or making excuses not to play tennis, your body is telling you something important. Don't let pain steal your quality of life.

### 3. You're Relying on Pain Medication
Over-the-counter pain relievers are meant for temporary relief, not daily management. If you're reaching for ibuprofen or acetaminophen regularly, it's time to address the root cause.

### 4. Your Sleep Is Affected
Pain that wakes you up at night or prevents you from getting comfortable is a clear sign that something needs attention. Poor sleep affects healing and can make pain worse.

### 5. You've Lost Range of Motion
Can't reach overhead like you used to? Trouble turning your neck to check blind spots while driving? Loss of mobility often happens gradually, but it's a serious warning sign.

## Why Early Intervention Matters

The longer you wait, the more your body compensates for the problem. These compensations can create new issues in other areas, turning one problem into several.

**With AI-assisted movement analysis**, I can identify these compensation patterns before they become painful problems themselves. This technology allows us to see exactly how your body is moving and create a precise plan to restore normal function.

## What to Expect in Your First Visit

- Comprehensive movement assessment using AI technology
- Hands-on evaluation to identify the root cause
- Immediate pain relief techniques
- Personalized exercise plan you can start right away
- Clear explanation of what's happening and how we'll fix it

## The Bottom Line

Your body is incredibly good at adapting, but those adaptations aren't always healthy in the long run. The sooner we can identify and correct movement problems, the faster and more complete your recovery will be.

Don't wait for the pain to get worse. If any of these signs sound familiar, it's time to take action.
