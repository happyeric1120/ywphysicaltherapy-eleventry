## 🔍 The 5 Warning Signs You Shouldn’t Ignore

### 1️⃣ Pain That Lasts More Than 3 Days  
If you've been in pain for more than a few days, it’s time to pay attention. What seems like a minor tweak can easily become chronic without proper care.


### 2️⃣ Avoiding Activities You Love  
Skipping your morning jog? Hesitating to lift your child or play sports? These aren’t just habits — they’re signs your body needs help.


### 3️⃣ Relying on Pain Meds Regularly  
Taking ibuprofen or acetaminophen daily is a band-aid, not a solution. Physical therapy can address the **real cause** behind the pain.


### 4️⃣ Your Sleep Is Affected  
Pain that disrupts your sleep is your body begging for support. Poor sleep delays healing and makes pain worse.


### 5️⃣ Loss of Range of Motion  
Can’t reach overhead? Trouble checking blind spots? These are early signs your joints and muscles are struggling — and need attention.


## ⚠️ Why Early Intervention Matters

The longer you wait, the more your body adapts **in unhealthy ways** — creating compensation patterns that cause even more issues.

With **AI-assisted movement analysis**, I can detect these subtle imbalances before they lead to injury. It’s like giving your body a precision tune-up — early, smart, and effective.


## 👣 What to Expect During Your First Visit

✅ Full-body AI movement assessment  
✅ Hands-on clinical evaluation  
✅ Immediate relief strategies (manual therapy, shockwave, etc.)  
✅ A personalized exercise plan  
✅ Clear explanation of your condition and how to fix it


## 💡 The Takeaway

Your body is amazing at adapting — but those adaptations aren’t always healthy. The **sooner we intervene**, the better your recovery and long-term health will be.
