  <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-teal-400 mb-6">What Is Compex EMS?</h2>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-200 mb-6">
    <span class="font-semibold text-teal-300">Compex Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS)</span> uses precise electrical
    impulses to activate your muscles in a controlled way. In my Midtown Manhattan studio near Penn Station, I use
    Compex EMS to help with neuromuscular activation, recovery, pain relief, and performance—especially when certain
    muscles are “lazy,” underactive, or not firing well during movement.
  </p>

  <p class="text-lg text-gray-200 mb-6">
    Instead of just putting pads on and letting a machine run, I combine EMS with specific positions and movement
    patterns so your brain, nervous system, and muscles learn to work together. This is especially powerful when paired
    with <a href="/shockwave" class="text-teal-300 underline">shockwave therapy</a>,
    <a href="/class-4-laser" class="text-teal-300 underline">Class 4 laser</a>, TRX training, or
    <a href="/aeke-k1" class="text-teal-300 underline">smart gym resistance work</a>.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">How Does It Work?</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 mb-8 space-y-2">
    <li>
      <span class="font-medium text-teal-300">Muscle Activation:</span>
      Electrical impulses cause controlled muscle contractions, helping “remind” the muscle how to turn on effectively.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="font-medium text-teal-300">Pain Modulation:</span>
      TENS-style settings can reduce pain by interrupting pain signals and helping the nervous system calm down.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="font-medium text-teal-300">Recovery Support:</span>
      Gentle contraction programs help improve blood flow and reduce post-workout soreness or stiffness.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="font-medium text-teal-300">Strength Assistance:</span>
      EMS can help maintain or rebuild muscle activity when you can’t load fully yet due to pain or recent injury.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-teal-400 mb-2">How I Use Compex EMS in Treatment</h3>
  <div class="bg-gray-800 rounded-xl px-6 py-5 mb-8">
    <ul class="list-disc ml-4 text-gray-200 space-y-2">
      <li>Glute activation for people who overuse their low back or hamstrings</li>
      <li>Quad activation after knee pain, surgery, or long-term “knee guarding”</li>
      <li>Improving left–right asymmetry in strength or control</li>
      <li>Helping stabilizing muscles “wake up” around the hip, knee, or shoulder</li>
      <li>Supporting recovery after heavy training days or competitions</li>
      <li>Adding extra stimulus when we can’t yet load with full bodyweight or heavy resistance</li>
    </ul>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">Benefits of Compex EMS</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 mb-8 space-y-1">
    <li>Better muscle recruitment and neuromuscular control</li>
    <li>Faster recovery after workouts, runs, or sports</li>
    <li>Non-medication option for managing pain and tightness</li>
    <li>Improved strength/endurance in underactive muscles</li>
    <li>Support during rehab when full loading is not yet possible</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">What Does a Session Feel Like?</h3>
  <p class="text-gray-200 mb-6">
    Depending on the program, you’ll feel anything from a gentle tingling to stronger, rhythmic muscle contractions.
    I always start at a comfortable level and gradually increase as your body adapts. Most people describe it as
    unusual at first but quickly get used to it—and many find it surprisingly relaxing when paired with the right
    positions and breathing.

    <p class="text-gray-200 mb-4">
      If you feel like certain muscles never “turn on,” or you keep compensating with the wrong areas, Compex EMS can be
      a powerful tool to retrain your system. I’ll help you decide when and how to use it as part of your plan.
