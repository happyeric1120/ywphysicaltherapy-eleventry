  <!-- WHAT IS LASER -->
  <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-teal-400 mb-6">What Is Class 4 Laser Therapy?</h2>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-200 mb-6">
    My <span class="font-semibold text-teal-300">Class 4 Laser Therapy</span> uses high-powered, medical-grade light
    to boost your body’s natural healing process. Unlike cold laser or LED devices, Class 4 lasers penetrate deep into
    muscles, tendons, ligaments, and joints—helping reduce pain, speed up recovery, and improve mobility.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-200 mb-6">
    I use Class 4 Laser as part of my one-on-one physical therapy approach here in Midtown Manhattan near Penn Station.
    Many people come to me after trying massage, stretching, or other treatments that only help temporarily. Laser
    helps calm inflammation, improve tissue healing, and prepare the body for corrective exercise or additional advanced
    therapies like <a href="/shockwave" class="text-teal-300 underline">focused and radial shockwave</a>,
    <a href="/tecar" class="text-teal-300 underline">TECAR therapy</a>, or
    <a href="/compex" class="text-teal-300 underline">Compex EMS</a>.

  <!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">How the Laser Works</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 mb-8 space-y-2">
    <li>
      <span class="font-medium text-teal-300">Deep Tissue Penetration:</span>
      Class 4 lasers reach deeper layers of tissue compared to standard cold laser or LED therapy.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="font-medium text-teal-300">Cellular Activation:</span>
      The laser energy stimulates mitochondria to accelerate cellular repair, reduce inflammation, and enhance circulation.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="font-medium text-teal-300">Pain Reduction:</span>
      Most people feel relief during or shortly after the session—the calming effect continues for hours afterward.
    </li>
  </ul>
