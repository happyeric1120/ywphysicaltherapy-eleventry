  <!-- WHAT IS RRT -->
  <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-teal-400 mb-6">What Is Rapid Release Therapy?</h2>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-200 mb-6">
    <span class="font-semibold text-teal-300">Rapid Release Therapy (RRT)</span> is a high-frequency vibration device
    designed to target scar tissue, adhesions, muscle tightness, and sensitive trigger points. I use it in my Midtown
    Manhattan studio near Penn Station as a gentle but effective way to relax irritated soft tissue and improve mobility
    without aggressive pressure or discomfort.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-200 mb-6">
    Unlike massage guns or percussive devices, Rapid Release operates at a much higher vibration frequency. This helps
    soften restricted fascia, calm superficial nerve irritation, and release tension in areas that respond poorly to
    deep pressure. I often combine it with <a href="/shockwave" class="text-teal-300 underline">shockwave therapy</a>,
    <a href="/tecar" class="text-teal-300 underline">TECAR therapy</a>, or
    <a href="/class-4-laser" class="text-teal-300 underline">Class 4 laser</a> for quicker, longer-lasting results.

  <!-- SESSION FEEL -->
  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">What Does a Session Feel Like?</h3>
  <p class="text-gray-200 mb-6">
    You’ll feel fast, gentle vibrations over the treatment area—most people describe it as relaxing and soothing. I use
    Rapid Release in short, targeted intervals to soften tension before movement training, shockwave, TECAR, or laser
    work. Sessions are quick but often surprisingly effective for stubborn tightness.

      If you feel stiff, tight, or restricted—or certain spots always feel “stuck”—Rapid Release Therapy may help your
      tissue relax so we can restore normal movement more effectively.
